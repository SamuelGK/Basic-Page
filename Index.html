<h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>



<p>I am Andrew Ryan, and I’m here to ask you a question. 
    Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? ‘No!’ says the man in Washington, ‘It belongs to the poor.’ ‘No!’ says the man in the Vatican, ‘It belongs to God.’ ‘No!’ says the man in Moscow, ‘It belongs to everyone.’ 
    I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose… Rapture, a city where the artist would not fear the censor, where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality, Where the great would not be constrained by the small! 
    And with the sweat of your brow, Rapture can become your city as well.</p>

<p>If you are fond of games then you might know where that quote came from. 
    Here is a list of iconic videogames</p>

    Tetris
    tetris gameBet you didn’t see THIS one coming! Just kidding, it probably popped into your head when you read the article title. But listen, when it comes to the old heads that don’t play video games, you ask them for three game titles, at least 50% of them will say Tetris.
    
    Wii Sports
    wii sportsWii sports is an undeniably great time. If Pacman could be more like Wii sports, maybe the roller rink wouldn’t have shut down, and maybe Pacman would have a better spot on the list. But no, only Wii sports can be like Wii sports.
    
    This game is definitely popular, fun for all ages, and has sold a ton of copies. The only issue is that it was bundled with all the Wii sales except for maybe in Japan. So maybe Wii sports is only popular because it’s friend The Wii is popular. We’ll never know.
    
    Sonic the HedgeHog
    sonic the hedgehog gameSome of the entries on this list make more sense as the whole franchise rather than an individual game. Sonic, for example, probably rose to popularity on the Sega Genesis and the Game Gear. Not so much on the Dreamcast (RIP sega systems). People recognize him, though. Maybe he just has one of those faces.
    
    The Sims
    sims 1 gameLol. This is the one game that, no matter how many times you get it to go into the swimming pool and take the ladder away, will not die. We won’t lie, we pumped plenty of hours into constructing our own homes, putting dirty dishes on the floor, rose budding, and setting the kitchen on fire.
    
    It can be a fun game. And it has serious appeal outside of your typical gamer base.
    
    Diablo III
    diablo 3 gameThis game sold a surprising amount of copies. We had no idea it was as popular as it was. Awesome characters, sweet loot, Blizzard… It’s easy to see why this one was a hit.
    
    Super Mario Bros.
    super mario bros gameYou think Diablo III moved some copies, it has nothing on the Super Mario Bros! A timeless classic, everyone knows who they are. Now the argument could be made that people only know of the Mario Bros because of that smash-hit, live-action film that came out in 1993. If anyone makes that argument they’re dead wrong. Terrible movie, watch it sometime!
    
    Super Smash Brothers
    super smash brosWhen it “Wah”s it “Wah-HOooooo”s. Super Mario 64, anyone? No? Ok, that’s fine. Here we are again with a franchise. A lot of people love the original on the N64. Others like them the newer they get. Either way, people know this franchise, people ask for it when you bust out any Nintendo console. SSB is populaaaaaaar.
    
    Pokemon
    pokemon gameThere’s no party like a Nintendo party, as Japan goes for the hattrick. Yes, Pokemon! What a franchise! If we had to pick the generation, we would say Red and Blue (and Yellow if you want to be all-inclusive). The new games are great, but you can’t top the fever behind the first generation release.
    
    The Legend of Zelda
   otA or LoL have. We heard the Xbox version was getting remastered for Xbox One (just kidding, don’t believe us, we aren’t telling the truth).
